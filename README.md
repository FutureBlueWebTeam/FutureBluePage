# FutureBluePage

## About 

This is the web page designed by the previous year of interns to replace the Future Blue wordpress site as a hub of intern and potential intern activity.

## Development

To start developoing, all the secrets have been sanatized from the repo, so you will need to work without them or talk to Thomas Mullen about working on the site. 

## Getting started 

Run the command:

`npm install` 

to install dependencies. The command:

`node app.js` 

can be used to start the site.
